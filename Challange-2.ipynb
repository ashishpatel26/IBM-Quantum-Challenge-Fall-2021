    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic Light Emitting Diodes or OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Recent studies ([**Gao et al., 2021**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00540-6)) have been looking at electronic transitions of high energy states in **phenylsulfonyl-carbazole ($PSPCz$) molecules**, which could be useful **thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)** emitters for OLED technology. **TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency (IQE)**, i.e the fraction of the charge carriers in a circuit or system that emit absorbed photons, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones, which could in turn lead to future developments where virtually any surface can be converted into a cheap and energy-efficient lighting source covering vast areas of homes, offices, museums and more!\n",

    "### Why quantum?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers could be invaluable tools for studying the electronic structure and dynamical properties of complex molecules and materials as it makes more sense to model quantum mechanical systems on a quantum device than on a classical computer. A recent joint research project by IBM Quantum and partners was successful in developing methods to improve accuracy for the calculation of excited TADF states for efficient OLEDs, making it the world's first research case of applying quantum computers to the calculation of excited states of commercial materials (see paper linked above for reference). \n",
    "    \n",
    "With this background information, we are interested in describing quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient OLED devices."

You will first need to use `prepare_ex2f` to submit a runtime job to IBM Quantum (to run on a simulator), using `runtime_vqe (VQEProgram)`, `qubit_converter (QubitConverter)`, `es_problem (ElectronicStructureProblem)`. Depending on the queue, the job can take up to a few minutes to complete. Under the hood, the `prepare_ex2f` does the following:\n",
